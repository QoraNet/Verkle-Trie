// Package memory implements a simple reference Verkle trie (S6) for the qordb
// project providing
//   - a proof-of-concept implementation of the Verkle trie in qordb
//   - an executable specification for developers
//   - a light-weight reference implementation for testing of other components
//
// The implementation is maintained to be suitable for testing purposes for all
// potential use cases, with the following limitations:
//   - it retains all data in memory, so it can not scale to large datasets
//   - there is no support for checkpointing to recover from crashes
//
// WARNING: This package is not intended for production use. It is a reference
// implementation and is not optimized for performance or memory usage. It is
// also lacking sufficient testing and error handling. It is only intended
// to be used as a reference for the Verkle trie implementation in qordb
