# Verkle Trie (VT) Implementation

## üìö Introduction to Verkle Tries

**Verkle** is an amalgamation of "**vector**" and "**Merkle**", representing an advanced data structure that combines the tree-like organization of Merkle trees with efficient vector commitments.

### How Verkle Tries Work

Traditional Merkle trees store a hash of the `d` nodes below at each level (where `d=2` for binary Merkle trees). Verkle tries, however, commit to the `d` nodes below using a **vector commitment** instead of simple hashing.

### Why Traditional d-ary Merkle Trees Are Inefficient

In a `d`-ary Merkle tree, each proof must include all unaccessed siblings for each node on the path to a leaf. This means:

- A `d`-ary Merkle tree needs **(d-1) √ó log_d(n) = (d-1) √ó log(n) / log(d)** hashes for a single proof
- This is **worse** than binary Merkle trees, which only need **log(n)** hashes
- The inefficiency stems from hash functions being poor vector commitments‚Äîproofs require all siblings to be provided

### The Verkle Advantage

Better vector commitments change this equation fundamentally:

- **KZG polynomial commitment scheme** is used as the vector commitment
- Each level requires only a **constant-size proof**
- The annoying factor of **(d-1)** that kills `d`-ary Merkle trees **disappears**
- Proofs remain compact even with high branching factors

### Structure

A Verkle trie is a trie where:
- **Inner nodes** are `d`-ary vector commitments to their children
- The **i-th child** contains all nodes with the prefix `i` as a `d`-digit binary number
- Common implementations use `d=256` (one byte per level)

**Example:** A `d=16` Verkle trie efficiently stores keys by grouping them into 16-way branches at each level, with cryptographic commitments ensuring integrity without requiring all sibling hashes in proofs.

### Benefits Over Merkle Patricia Tries (MPT)

1. **Smaller proofs** - Constant size per level vs. linear in siblings
2. **Efficient state synchronization** - Compact witness proofs
3. **Better performance** - Fewer hashing operations for verification
4. **Future-proof** - Designed for stateless clients and light nodes
